    <h3>
      This lemon chicken orzo soup is inspired by Panera Bread's version. It is
      so flavorful with tender pieces of chicken in a lemony broth with orzo
      pasta, carrots, onions, celery, and baby spinach. This has quickly become
      one of my family's very favorite soup recipes.
    </h3>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces orzo pasta</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 medium carrots, chopped, or more to taste</li>
      <li>3 ribs celery, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in orzo and
        return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered until partially cooked through
        but not yet soft, about 5 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water until
        cooled completely.
      </p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, and
        onion; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften and onion becomes
        translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant,
        about 1 minute more. Season mixture with thyme, oregano, bay leaf, salt,
        and black pepper; continue cooking another 30 seconds before pouring
        chicken broth into the pot.
      </p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>
        Bring broth to a boil. Partially cover the pot, reduce heat to
        medium-low, and simmer until vegetables are just tender, about 10
        minutes.
      </p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>
        Stir orzo, lemon juice, and lemon zest into broth; add chicken. Cook
        until chicken and orzo are heated through, about 5 minutes. Add baby
        spinach; cook until spinach wilts into broth and orzo is tender, 2 to 3
        minutes. Ladle soup into bowls; garnish with lemon slices and Parmesan
        cheese.
